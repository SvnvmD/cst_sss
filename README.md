Project Background:
----------------------------------------------
The security cameras installed in various places capture video footage. However the                 footage is automatically deleted after a certain period of time from the server due to limited storage capacity. Taking the scenario of College of Science and Technology (CST), with the current security system it is difficult to verify whether the person entering through the gate is an authorized individual or an intruder. It also requires human labor (security guards) to monitor and guard. It is also seen that guards tend to slack off on their duty usually falling asleep or not being diligently present on their post. This is one of the major setback in the current security system which can be easily taken advantage of by intruders.
